# 🛰️ KoshaTrack SSA Engine: Tier-Zero Sovereign Space Defense 🛰️🇮🇳

KoshaTrack is a high-stakes Space Situational Awareness (SSA) platform. This repository contains the **Hardened Sovereign Kernel** designed for the iDEX ADITI mission.

## 🛡️ The "Zero-Trust" Security Moat
Unlike standard SSA tools, KoshaTrack is built on the **PrivateVault Security Architecture**:
* **Physics-Informed Verification:** Automatically rejects "Spoofed TLEs" or adversarial data that violates Keplerian orbital laws.
* **Red-Black Separation:** Logic is decoupled from data storage, ensuring that orbital state vectors remain air-gapped from the compute engine.
* **Integrity Auditing:** Every calculation generates a PrivateVault-compatible signature for legal "Chain of Custody" in space law disputes.

## 🚀 Capabilities
* **HPOP Engine:** High-Precision Orbit Propagation aware of atmospheric drag.
* **Elastic Infrastructure:** Terraform-ready for deployment on sovereign EKS clusters.
* **Free for GoI:** Released under PolyForm Noncommercial License for national security use.

**Secure. Sovereign. Unstoppable.**
