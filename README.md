# KoshaTrack SSA Engine: Tier-Zero Sovereign Space Defense 🛰️🇮🇳

**KoshaTrack** is an advanced, dual-use Space Situational Awareness (SSA) platform designed for NASA-grade autonomous collision avoidance and high-stakes defense applications.

## 🚀 Tier-Zero Capabilities
Unlike standard tracking software, KoshaTrack is engineered for the **Contested Space Domain**:
* **Multi-Hypothesis Tracking (MHT):** Propagates multiple potential trajectories for uncorrelated objects (UCTs) and dark debris.
* **Hypersonic Threat Detection:** Real-time classification of non-Keplerian, sub-orbital trajectories (Mach 5+).
* **Cislunar Awareness:** Deep-space tracking beyond GEO using Circular Restricted Three-Body Problem (CR3BP) physics.
* **Physics-Informed ML Defense:** Zero-trust ingestion pipeline that flags adversarial TLE spoofing via orbital energy verification.

## 🛠️ Technical Architecture
- **Core:** High-Precision Orbit Propagator (HPOP) with 7-day Solar Weather (NRLMSISE-00) integration.
- **Security:** Red-Black architecture for air-gapped MoD deployments.
- **Scalability:** Distributed processing via Ray/Dask for LEO mega-constellation management.
- **Trust:** Immutable Blockchain Audit Trail for international space law compliance.
